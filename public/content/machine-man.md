# Machine Man

_Machine Man_ is an AI-powered Telegram bot designed to bring the capabilities of cutting-edge artificial intelligence models for text and image generation directly to Telegram users. This project enhances user experience by integrating advanced AI technologies into a widely-used messaging platform.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of _Machine Man_ is to empower Telegram users with the ability to generate text and images seamlessly within their chat interface. This tool opens up new possibilities for creative communication and content generation by leveraging state-of-the-art AI models.

## Features

- **Text Generation**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 to produce human-like text based on user-provided prompts, enabling dynamic and creative text content generation.

- **Image Generation**: Implements the DALL-E model to create unique images from textual descriptions, offering a visual element to the AI-driven interaction.

- **Multi-Model Support**: Offers flexibility by allowing users to select from a variety of AI models, ensuring diverse outputs that cater to different needs and preferences.

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: Serves as the core programming language for developing the bot, providing robustness and ease of integration with various APIs.

- **Telegram Bot API**: Facilitates seamless interaction with the Telegram platform, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **llama 3/OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: Powers the text generation feature, utilizing its advanced natural language processing capabilities.

- **playground 2.5/kandinsky 3**: Enables image generation by transforming textual descriptions into unique visual content.

## Architecture
